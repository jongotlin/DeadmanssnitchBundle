# DeadmanssnitchBundle


## Install

composer require jongotlin/deadmanssnitch-bundle
composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter


## TODO 

As soon as [PHP-HTTP](http://docs.httplug.io/en/latest/) is stable we will use the following in composer.json: 
 
```
     "require": {
         "dizda/cloud-backup-bundle": "dev-master",
         "php-http/adapter-implementation": "~1.0"
     },
     "require-dev": {
         "php-http/guzzle6-adapter": "~1.0",
         "php-http/discovery": "~1.0"
     },
 
```
